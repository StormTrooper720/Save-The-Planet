# Save-The-Planet!
A game I made in my Coding 1 class in high school.

## About
Your goal is to save the planet from the invading aliens by shooting them with your blaster. Your goal is to kill as many aliens as possible and progress through the levels to gain more points. Although your goal is to save the planet, there is no end. Every level is procederally generated. Only the last few levels you go through are saved for you to go back to.

## Cool Stuff
I implemted the ability to save the game to your browser's local storage, saving your score, position, velocity, aliens (there positions), level data, etc. This allows you to be able to completely close your browser, turn off your computer, etc and still be able to play later. 

## BUgs
There are some bugs in the game, notibly visual ones with the gun.

## Other Info
This game was originally made in CodeHS, so extra code I added (from a CodeHS tutorial) allows it to be played without CodeHS.
Enjoy!
